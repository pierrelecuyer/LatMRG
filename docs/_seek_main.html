SeekMain</h1>
<p>This is the main program to search for the "best" (or "worst") multiple recursive generators of a given form, based on a criteria based on the Beyer quotient or on the spectral test. It produces a report listing the retained generators, their properties, and various statistics on the search.</p>
<p>One can search for combined MRGs with \(J\) components, or simple MRGs \((J=1)\). For a single MRG (or for each component, in case \(J &gt; 1\)), with given modulus \(m\) and order \(k\), the program searches for vectors of multipliers inside the region bounded by the vectors \(b = (b_1,…,b_k)\) and \(c = (c_1,…,c_k)\) such that \(-m &lt; b_i\le c_i &lt; m\) for each \(i\). The search can be exhaustive in that region, or random. One can search only among maximal period generators (for each component), or not consider the period and examine only the lattice structure. The former (checking maximal period conditions) can be done only if \(m\) is prime, or if \(k=1\) and \(m\) is a power of a prime. The program can also list the retained generators in a file, in a format more compact than the standard one that can be re-used as input to the program, in a later run. This could be useful, for example, if one wishes to perform first a screening over a large region, based on a criterion that does not require expensive computations, and then do a second pass over the retained generators, based on a more stringent criterion, such as looking at the lattice structure in higher dimensions, and/or verifying the results by performing all computations using error bounds.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="method_seek"></a>
Searching method</h2>
<p>For an exhaustive search for MRGs, all vectors of multipliers of the form \(a = (a_1,…,a_k)\) such that \(b_i\le a_i\le c_i\) for \(i=1,…,k\) will be examined, for a total of \(N_v = \prod_{i=1}^k (c_i-b_i+1)\) vectors. This holds for each component. Therefore, if there are \(J\) components and \(N_{v,j}\) vectors are examined for component \(j\), then a total of \(\prod_{j=1}^J N_{v,j}\) generators are examined.</p>
<p>For a random search for MRGs, we fix a number of subregions (clusters) we want to examine, and the size \(h_i\) of each subregion in dimension \(i\), for \(i=1,…,k\). The program will examine a total of \(n\prod_{i=1}^k h_i\) vectors of multipliers (for each MRG component) by repeating \(n\) times the following: For \(i=1,…,k\), generate \(\alpha_i\) randomly, uniformly over the set \(\{b_i,…,c_i-h_i+1\}\); then, examine all the vectors \(a = (a_1,…,a_k)\) such that \(\alpha_i\le a_i\le\alpha_i+h_i-1\) for each \(i\).</p>
<p>When examining a vector \(a\), the program first checks if the maximal period conditions are satisfied, if this is required. For prime modulus \(m\), the condition </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[((-1)^{k+1} a_k)^{(m-1)/q}\ \mathrm{mod} \ m \neq 1,\ \forall q | m-1\]
</p>
<p> is verified only once for each distinct value of \(a_k\) (which corresponds to \(\prod_{i=1}^{k-1} h_i\) different values). To verify the maximal period conditions, the factorizations of \(m-1\) and \(r = (m^k-1)/(m-1)\) are required. They can be found by the program, if desired, or provided by the user in a file (see below). All factorizations depend on the inclusion of the <code>yafu</code> executable in the right path. More information is provided about that in the installation instructions. Factoring \(r\) can take <em>huge</em> amounts of time. To avoid redoing the factorization, it is possible to print the factorization results in a file. The factorizations of \(m-1\) et \(r\) are necessary only when \(m\) is prime and maximal period is required.</p>
<p>If \(a\) is not rejected by the maximal period test, then we move forward to the next MRG component and try all the vectors for that next component (by exhaustive or random search) and examine their combination with the currently examined multipliers for the previous components. For each combined generator, the values of \(d_t\) or \(q_t\) are computed for dimensions \(k+1,…,T\).</p>
<p>The program always keeps lower and upper bounds on the figure of merit ( \(M_T\) or \(Q_T\)), in each dimension, for the generator to be worth considering. The initial values of these bounds are given by the user in the fields <em>MinMerit</em> and <em>MaxMerit</em>. The lower bound can be 0.0 and the upper bound can be 1.0, which means that there is no effective bounds for some categories if desired.</p>
<p>As soon as a generator has a figure of merit below the lower bound in a given dimension, or above the upper bound for its category (after the computations for all the dimensions in this category have been completed), then this generator is immediately discarded and no further computations are made for it. This can save enormous amounts of time in the case of very large searches up to high dimensions, because with good bounds, few generators will reach the large dimensions.</p>
<p>During execution, only the bounds for the last category can be modified. If the figure of merit for the last category is to be <em>maximized</em>, when we have found enough [i.e., <em>NbGen</em>( \(C\))] generators with a figure of merit \(\ge\sigma\), where \(\sigma\) is larger than the lower bound for the last category, then we raise this lower bound to \(\sigma\). Similarly, if we minimize in the last category, we can lower the upper bound when we have enough generators beating the bound. In the case where the figure of merit is to be <em>maximized in all</em> the categories, then a generator is also discarded as soon as its figure of merit in <em>any</em> dimension gets below the lower bound of the last category.</p>
<p>The set of dimensions in which the test is applied can be partitioned into a certain number of intervals, or categories, and one can use a different selection criterion for the generators within each category. One can also impose bounds on the figure of merit within each category: see the data fields for <code>C</code>, <code>MinMerit</code> and <code>MaxMerit</code> below. For example, one can consider only the generators with \(M_8 \ge 0.6\), and, among these, retain the list of generators with the smallest value of \(M_{12}\). As another example, one can retain the 2 generators with the highest \(M_8\), the 2 generators with the highest \(M_{16}\) and the eight generators with the highest \(M_{32}\).</p>
<p>The execution (CPU) time is checked before testing each new generator. When it exceeds the CPU time limit given in the data file, the search is aborted and the partial results are printed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="executable_seek"></a>
The executable programs</h2>
<p>Three different executable programs are compiled by the <code>makefile</code> from <code>SeekMain</code>. Each of those executable uses a different types combination :</p><ul>
<li><code>SeekLLDD</code> uses the standard C++ <code>int64_t</code> and <code>double</code> to represent every number needed by the program. This is the recommended parameter for small applications/testing implementations as it is the fastest one.</li>
<li><code>SeekZZDD</code> uses <code>NTL::ZZ</code> to represent integers in the basis of the lattices, but uses <code>double</code> to represent and make computation of vector length/figures of merit. This parameter is best used when doing <code>real scale</code> applications, when searching for 64-bit MRGs for example.</li>
<li><code>SeekZZRR</code> uses both <code>NTL::ZZ</code> for integers and <code>NTL::RR</code> for floating point numbers. This is only usefull when testing a small set of generators or when testing generators with an absurdly big modulo (which could happen when testing MWC generators for example). The LatticeTester module <code>Types</code> includes a comprehensive guide on how to choose the types depending on the use case.</li>
</ul>

</pre> <center> <b>Data file format for <code>SeekMain</code></b> </center><p>The data for <code>SeekMain</code> must be placed in a file with extension <code>.dat</code>, according to the format displayed <a class="el" href="_seek_main.html#input_format_seek">above</a>. The fields in square brackets are optional (depending on the value taken by the first field on the line). The meaning of all data fields is explained below. To run the program, type <code>./bin/SeekMain /path/to/file</code>, where <code>/path/to/file.dat</code> is the name of the data file containing the test to execute. The results will be printed either in a file <code>/path/to/file.res</code> or <code>path/to/file.gen</code> depending on <code>OutpoutType</code> (see below).</p>
<p>The values of \(m\), \(b_i\), and \(c_i\) in the data file can be given in one of the two following formats:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An integer giving the value directly, in base 10. In this case, there <em>must</em> be some other non-numeric text (e.g., a comment) on this data line after the integer.</li>
<li>Three integers \(x\), \(e\), and \(z\) on the same line, separated by at least one blank. The retained value will be \(x^e+z\) if \(x\ge0\), and \(-(|x|^e+z)\) if \(x&lt;0\). The value of \(e\) must be positive. For example, <code>[x e z] = [2 5 -1]</code> will give <code>31</code>, while <code>[x e z] = [-2 5 -1]</code> will give <code>-31</code> (not <code>-33</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>If the types chosen are LLDD, then the numbers used here must fit in a 64 bits integers. In the other cases, it won't matter.</p>

Meaning of the data fields</h2>
<p>We explain the meaning of all the fields of the data file. For every line, of the data file, the options for the mandatory fields are listed between inequality signs as <code>&lt;option1, option2, ...&gt;</code> while the options for the optionnal/situationnal fields are listed in square brackets as <code>[option1, option2, ...]</code>.</p>

<dd>the multipliers must satisfy the condition \(|a_i| (m\mod|a_i|) &lt; m\), called "approximate factoring", for each \(i\). MRGs are often easier to implement under this condition <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_rLEC90a">[30]</a>&thinsp;.  </dd>

For example, if <em>s</em> = 2 and <em> \(k_1\)</em> = 30, there are \(30 \times31 /2\) possibilities for choosing the 2 powers of 2 and 4 possibilities for choosing their signs, yielding 1860 cases where \(a_i\) is obtained from exactly 2 powers of 2. If one adds the \(62\) cases where \(a_i\) is \(\pm\) a power of 2, this gives a total of 1922 possibilities for \(a_i\). In the case of <code>PowerTwo</code>, the bounds \(b_j\) and \(c_j\) on the multipliers (see below) are automatically reset to \(b_j = -(2^{e+1}-1)\) and \(c_j = 2^{e+1}-1\).  </dd>

For example, for a MRG of order \(k=10\), the line <code>"NonZero 4 2 5 8 10"</code> will consider only vector of multipliers of the form \(\mathbf{a} = (0, \alpha, 0, 0, \beta, 0, 0, \gamma, 0, \delta)\) where \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\) are arbitrary integers in their respective interval \([b_i, c_i]\). ( \(\mathbf{a_0}\) is unused). In that case, only \(s\) pairs \([b_i, c_i]\) must appear in the lines for \([b_i, c_i]\) below.  </dd>
<dt><code>Equal</code> \(s\) \({k_1}\) \({k_2}\) \(\cdots\) \({k_s}\): </dt>

There are \(s\) groups: the first group of \(k_1\) multipliers are all equal, the second group of \(k_2 - k_1\) multipliers are all equal, and so on until the last group of \((k - k_{s-1})\) multipliers which are all equal. \(k_j\) is the vector index of the last element of group \(j\). For example, for a MRG of order \(k=10\), the line <code>"Equal 4 2 5 8 10"</code> will consider only vector of multipliers of the form \(\mathbf{a} = (\alpha, \alpha, \beta, \beta, \beta, \gamma, \gamma, \gamma, \delta, \delta)\) where \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\) are arbitrary integers in their respective interval \([b_i, c_i]\). ( \(\mathbf{a_0}\) is unused). Elements \(a_3 = a_4 =a_5\) are the elements of the second group. In that case, only \(s\) pairs \([b_i, c_i]\) must appear in the lines for \([b_i, c_i]\) below.  </dd>

Note that because of this, the values of <code>MinMerit[i]</code> should always be nondecreasing in <code>i</code>, because the lower bounds for all the previous categories also apply to any given category. As soon as a generator does not satisfy this criterion in a given dimension delimiting a category, it is discarded and no more time is spent to test it.

This data field currently is only used in the case of the spectral test, only if <code>d == 1</code>. It specifies if the spectral test should be accelerated by not doing the Branch-and-Bound algorithm. This can be usefull when doing a large scale search: the program will still be able to retain certain generators, with slightly worse figures of merit than their real values. After the search is done and generators have been retained, they can be tested more extensively by using the setting <code>0</code>.</p>

<dd>When this option is selected, the program executes normally.  </dd>
<dt>1: </dt>
<dd>When this option is selected, the figures of merit will only be computed with BKZ pre-reduction. The Branch-and-Bound will not be executed. The figures of merit will no longer be exact, but this can speed up the computations by a lot.  </dd>

<dl class="todo"><dt><b><a class="el" href="todo.html#_todo000010">Todo:</a></b></dt><dd>Most of those settings are not implemented. It is safer to stick to <code>Full</code> for now, but this also means that the lattice of generators without full period cannot be examined correctly.</dd></dl>

<dd>The grid generated by the (forward) orbit of a state of the (combined) generator is analyzed. This state is specified as follows.

<dt><code>PrimePower</code>: </dt>
<dd>In the case where some component is an MLCG whose modulus is a power of a prime \(p\), then the states visited over a single orbit (subcycle) of that component generate a sublattice (when \(a \equiv1 \bmod p\)) or belong to the union of \(p-1\) sublattices (otherwise). If <em>LatticeType</em> takes this value, if a component is an MLCG ( \(k=1\)), and if the modulus of that MLCG is given in the data file in the form (b): \((x e z)\) with \(z=0\) and \(x\) prime, then what is analyzed is one of those sublattices. This is done by dividing the modulus by the appropriate power of \(p\), as described in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_rLEC94e">[26]</a>&thinsp;. For example, if \(p=2\) and \(a \mod8 = 5\), then the modulus is divided by 4 as in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_rFIS90a">[12]</a>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_rKNU81a">[21]</a>&thinsp;.  </dd>

To analyze vectors of successive values (as usual), take \(s=d=1\). or \(s\) larger or equal to <em>MaxDim</em>. To analyze lacunary indices that are not evenly spaced, put \(s = -t\) where <em> \(t=\)MaxDim</em> and then, on the \(t\) lines that follow, give the \(t\) lacunary indices \(i_1,…,i_t\). . </p>
